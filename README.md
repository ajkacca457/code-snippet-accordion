# Accordion snippet react

-   Items are shown based on conditional rendering.
-   On click the id of that item will be selected as selectedId.
-   if the same item is clicked and if the item id is already selected then it will set the selected value as null (to implement toggle option)
-   based on the selectedId, another state (isActive) is added to see if the selected id is equal to item id.
-   based on isActive state, all the item will be rendered.
